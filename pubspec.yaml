# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:


  fonts:
    - family: SFProRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Regular.otf
    - family: SFProMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Medium.otf

    - family: SFProBold

        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Bold.otf
